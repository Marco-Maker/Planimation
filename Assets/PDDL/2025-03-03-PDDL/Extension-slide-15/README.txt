Solution to one of the extension proposed in slide 15 (plus some other features) including:

- not all rooms are connected (predicate connected)
- two robots (eve and wally)
- information about if a robot is allowed to enter the room (predicate allowed)

- Map.pdf illustrates where the problem file comes from, and specifies the rooms available, their connections and what rooms each robot is allowed to enter.
